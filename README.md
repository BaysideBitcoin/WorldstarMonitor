Worldst▲r Monitor - Bet▲ - By: juju
===========================

##Description:
This Cryptocurrency Monitor is software that utilizes various RESTAPI calls to Display and calculate market data from various Bitcoin Websites (Coinbase, Cryptsy, BTC-E, Blockchain.info)

Using C# Visual Studio .NET Libraries coupled with a few other open source libraries, I created a Cryptocurrency Monitor. It mainly has been used to calculate profits/losses for myself. It enabled me to view several websites data all at once and to monitor the worth of my portfolio.

##Notes:
I am going to be updating the structure and some of the other aspects of the code to be a bit more friendly for others to contribute. If anyone has any feature requests let me know, and I can see what I might be able to come up with.

Files needed along with the compiled exe inorder to run:
- RestSharp.dll - To expedite RESTAPI calls so I could get market data eaiser
- Newtonsoft.Json.dll - To unwrap the RESTAPI calls into objects eaiser.
- totallist.txt -  Input your total number of coins corresponding to the line position in coinlist.txt
- coinlist.txt - Do not edit this file, if you want a new coin added let me know and I can hook it up
- marketlist.txt - You can re-arrange the list of the order of the markets. Put your favorite markets ontop of this list and resafe the text file.

(Look in the ..\WorldstarMonitor\bin\Release\ for everything you would need to run the program)
