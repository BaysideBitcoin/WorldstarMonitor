Worldst▲r Crypto-Monitor - Bet▲ v3.0 - By:juju
================

Description:
Cryptocurrency Monitor is a peice of software that utilizes various RESTAPI calls to calculate cryptocurrency market data (Coinbase, Cryptsy, BTC-E, Blockchain.info)

Using C# Visual Studio .NET Libraries coupled with a few other open source libraries, I created a Cryptocurrency Monitor. It mainly has been used to calculate profits/losses for myself. It enabled me to view several websites data all at once and to monitor the worth of my portfolio.

Notes:
I am going to be updating the structure and some of the other aspects of the code to be a bit more friendly for others to contribute. If anyone has any feature requests let me know, and I can see what I might be able to come up with.

Their exist a few files along with the compiled exe inorder to run:

RestSharp.dll - To expedite RESTAPI calls so I could get market data eaiser
Newtonsoft.Json.dll - To unwrap the RESTAPI calls into objects eaiser.
totallist.txt -  Input your total number of coins corresponding to the line position in coinlist.txt
coinlist.txt - Do not edit this file, if you want a new coin added let me know and I can hook it up
marketlist.txt - You can re-arrange the list of the order of the markets. Put your favorite markets ontop of this list and resafe the text file.
